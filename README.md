# OS Aurora Compass Extension
This is a fork of the original Aurora compass extension which adds the `arcrturus` flavor. The immediate intent of this flavor is to extend the `polaris` flavor towards more accessible markup.

It should be noted that this code is never used directly within a build. Rather this codebase is the source for the gem that used to spin up the subtheme.

## Development Workflow
To be clear, this is the development workflow for **maintaining the gem source**, if you just want to use the extension to spin up a subtheme, head over to the [gem repo](https://github.com/opensourcery/os-ace_gem).

To get started, be sure you have the libraries for Sass+Compass ([install help](http://snugug.com/musings/installing-sass-and-compass-across-all-platform)):

* `ruby`, `rubygems`, and `compass`

The workflow is fairly straightforward:

* Make changes, and roll the gem:

`gem build compass-aurora-os.gemspec`

* Install locally:

`gem install compass-aurora-os-0.1.0.gem`

You might need admin/sudo for that one. Next, you want to do some local testing:

* Spin up a subtheme:

`compass create my_theme -r aurora-os --using aurora-os/arcturus --css-dir=css --javascripts-dir=js --fonts-dir=fonts`

* Install the dependncies

```bash
cd my_theme
bundle install
```

See if you got out of the spin up what you thought you did. Rinse. Repeat.

### Pushing an Update
Once you have everything together for and update, we want to up the version
number and date in `/os-ace/lib/os-aurora.rb`, then push to github. (We're using github for now as we are not sure if we want another gem on rubygems)
