# OS Aurora Compass Extension
This is a fork of the original Aurora compass extension which adds the `arcrturus` flavor. The immediate intent of this flavor is to extend teh `polaris` flavor towards more accessible markup.

## How to use within Turnip
This code is never used directly within the scope of [Turnip](https://github.com/opensourcery/turnip), rather the associated gem (coming soon) is used to
spin up an instance inside Turnip (this will eventually be scripted).
